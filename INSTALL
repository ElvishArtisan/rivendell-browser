This is the INSTALL file for the 'rivendell-producer' package.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
To build the package from source, you will need the following packages
installed and properly configured:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or later (http://www.qt.io/).


BUILDING
--------
Once the prequisites are set up, building the software is mostly a matter of
doing:

    ./configure
    make
    make install  [as 'root']

On RedHat-ish systems (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc) you can also make an
RPM by doing:

    make rpm


BUILDING WINDOWS BINARIES
-------------------------
The build system for rivendell-producer uses the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for
Windows) environment for building Windows binaries, available at
http://www.mingw.org/. It is also possible to build such binaries on CentOS 7
using the MinGW cross-compiler packages (available in EPEL). The following
environmental variables need to be configured in the MinGW configuration on
CentOS 7:
